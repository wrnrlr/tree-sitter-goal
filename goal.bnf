There is no bnf for goal, the closes we have is this cryptic grammer from k:

```
grammar:
  E : E ; E | e
  e : n v e | t e | ε
  t : n | v
  v : t A | V
  n : t [ E ] | ( E ) | { E } | N
```

## 1. Symbols
E, e, t, v, n → nonterminals (syntactic categories).
N, V, A → terminals (tokens):
N → a name or noun (atomic literal, variable, etc.).
V → a verb (function, operator).
A → adverb (modifier of a verb).
ε means “empty” (no symbol).
[ ], ( ), { }, ; are syntactic constructs in the language itself.

## 2. Productions
- `E : E ; E | e`
  → An expression E is either two expressions separated by ; (sequencing), or an e (a simpler expression).
- `e : n v e | t e | ε`
  → An e is either:
    - `n v e` → a noun followed by a verb followed by another e (verb phrases),
    - `t e` → a term followed by more,
    - or empty.
- `t : n | v`
  → A term is either a noun (n) or a verb (v).
- `v : t A | V`
  → A verb is either:
  - a term followed by an adverb (t A), or
  - a bare verb (V).
- `n : t [ E ] | ( E ) | { E } | N`
  → A noun is:
  - a term with indexing (t [ E ]),
  - or a grouped expression in parentheses (E),
  - or a lambda/block in braces {E},
  - or an atomic noun (N).

# 3. Meaning
This is the tiny formal grammar that defines the core expression structure in K:
- `;` separates statements.
- Parentheses `()` group expressions.
- Braces `{}` form function bodies.
- Square brackets `[]` are indexing / application.
- Verbs (`V`) can be modified by adverbs (`A`) to create new verbs.
- Expressions are fundamentally sequences of nouns and verbs (the array language “chain” style).

So in plain words:
This grammar says that a K expression is a sequence of noun/verb chains, possibly grouped, possibly separated by semicolons. Verbs may be atomic or modified by adverbs. Nouns may be atoms, grouped expressions, blocks, or indexed terms.
